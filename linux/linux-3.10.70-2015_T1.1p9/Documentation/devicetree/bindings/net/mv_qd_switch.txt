Marvell Distributed Switch Architecture Device Tree Bindings
------------------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "marvell,mv_qd_switch"
- #address-cells	: Must be 2, first cell is the address on the MDIO bus
			  and second cell is the address in the switch tree.
			  Second cell is used only when cascading/chaining.
- #size-cells		: Must be 0
- mii-bus		: Should be a phandle to a valid MDIO bus device node
- phy_addr		: Should be a phandle to a valid PHY device node accessed by MDIO
- cpu_port		: Should be Switch port number connected to CPU
- connected_port_mask	: Include all switch connected ports
- forced_link_port_mask	: Include switch ports with force link up configuration

Optionnal properties:
- interrupts		: property with a value describing the switch
			  interrupt number (not supported by the driver)


	mv_qd_switch {
		compatible = "marvell,mv_qd_switch";

		interrupts = <10>;
		mii-bus = <&mdio>;
		phy_addr = <&phy0>;	/* MDIO address of switch 0 in tree */
		smi_scan_mode = <0>;	/* scan smi mode */
		cpu_port = <6>;
		forced_link_port_mask = <0x60>;
		connected_port_mask = <0x7f>;
